<h3>PhotoViewer - Version 2 for assignment 4</h3>
This application will list the photo sets a Flickr User has made publicly available. Selection of a set will then display
photos of that set as thumbnails. If the user is logged in the thumbnails will be links to the larger version of the photo.

<pre>
- Requirements for assignment
  1. Stores a count of the requests for a particular flickr username in the database.
  2. MemCaches the data downloaded from Flickr for quicker dilevery to the user
  3. Provides links to the larger photos if the user is authenticated.
  
- How to test it
  1. Count increases for each submit click for a particular user
  2. Cache can be seen by annotated OK in the JSON response (the first OK will not be annotated)
  3. Links should appear in around the images once you log in.
  
- By using firebug you will be able to see the Ajax queries and what gets downloaded. Try entering the user name 'mernagh' 
  and you will see that this user has been queried prior. Viewing the JSON returned from the server you will see the
  term OK in a number of places. On subsequent requests it will actually say OK - CACHED. Note that I do not memcache the
  Data that I store in the DB just the data I retrieve from Flickr. This way the query count should keep increasing but
  the data returned will be the cached data.
