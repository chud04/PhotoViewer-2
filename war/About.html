    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>API from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api">Flickr</a></li>
      <li>Widgets used include - HorizontalPanel, TextBox, ListBox, and Button.</li>
      <li>Functionality: 
        <br/>
        <br/>1. Entering a username into the TextBox and hitting the submit button requests publicly viewable photo-set information for that user.
        It sets the output div to loading... while waiting for AJAX to return.
        <br/>The returned photo-sets populate the ListBox with the photo-set names. It also displays the set count in the output div.
        <br/> 
        <br/>2. Selecting a photo-set in the ListBox will send a request to the server for the photos in the selected photo-set.
        It sets the output div to loading... while waiting for AJAX.
        <br/>The returned photos populate the output div.
        <br/>
        <br/>3. I added history management to the page also. This allows the user to use the back &amp; forward buttons with AJAX requests. The
        data is not cached but the events fired are stored as parameters. This also allows for the sending of links via email/twitter/etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>4. I also added some exception handling. I did this in two ways. One is server side by using the PhotoViewerException class, 
        the other is client side by reading the JSON stat in the response.
        <br/><br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        The server processes XML in order to find the userid of the username searched for. The server then uses the Flickr JSONP API to 
        populate the FlickrUser attributes as strings. The client will evaluate the JSONP callbacks.
      </li>
      <li>I modified the CSS to keep it centered.</li>
    </ul>
